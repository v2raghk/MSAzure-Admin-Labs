Create a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure (Step-by-Step Guide)

This tutorial provides step by step details about how to create a Windows virtual machine via Azure portal.

Prerequisites: Microsoft Azure account

Permissions to create resources: Contributor role or above

Lets see the process in action.

Step 1: Sign In to Azure Portal

      Go to: https://portal.azure.com and enter your credentials.

Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine

      In the top search bar, type "Virtual Machines". Click + Create → Azure virtual machine.

Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

      Subscription: Choose your Azure subscription.
      Resource Group: Create a new one (e.g., RG-Demo-VM). Name the resources using a naming convention e.g. rg for resource group and so on.
      
      Virtual Machine Name: DemoVM101
      
      Region: Choose one close to your location (e.g.UK South)
      
      Availability Options: Leave default
      
      Image: Choose Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (or Ubuntu if you prefer Linux)
      
      Size: Click See all sizes → pick a size (e.g. Standard B2s)
      
      Username: Provide a username e.g. cloudadmin
      
      Password: Strong password. Make sure you provide a strong password to secure your virtual machine.
      
      Inbound Port Rules: Allow RDP (3389) or SSH (22) depending on OS
      
      Click Next: Disks

Step 4: Configure Disks (Optional)

      Choose Standard SSD or Premium SSD. For testing/development environments, using Standard SSD. For Production environments, use Premium SSD. Note that premium SSD is more expensive.
      Leave encryption and advanced settings default.
      
      Click Next: Networking

Step 5: Configure Networking

      Create new Virtual Network e.g. VNetDemo
      
      Subnet: Leave default
      
      Public IP: Yes (for internet access)
      
      NIC network security group (NSG): Select Basic
      
      Inbound ports: Allow selected ports (RDP or SSH)
      
      Click Next → accept defaults until the Review + Create step.

Step 6: Review + Create

      Validate your configuration. Click Create
      
      Azure will deploy your virtual machine. It takes apx 2 mins.

Step 7: Connect to VM

      After deployment, go to Virtual Machines → Select your VM. 
      
      Click Connect → RDP (for Windows) or SSH (for Linux)
      
      Use credentials you set earlier to log in

Tips & Best Practices:

      Delete VM after testing to avoid charges (don’t forget to delete the resource group as well).
      
      Enable Just-in-Time VM access from Microsoft Defender for security.
      
      Use Azure Bastion for more secure access. We will cover this in another tutorial.
      
      It is advisable to enable auto-shutdown on Dev/Test environments to save cost. Dont enable it on Production VMs.
