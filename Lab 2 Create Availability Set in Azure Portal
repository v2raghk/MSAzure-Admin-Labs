Lab 2: Level (Beginners)

Availability Sets (step-by-step guide)

Overview

      In Microsoft Azure, an Availability Set is a feature that ensures high availability for Virtual Machines. 
      Azure distributes VMs across multiple fault domains (physical hardware) and update domains (update schedule), reducing the risk of simultaneous downtime.
      
      Objective: Create an Availability Set and launch Virtual Machines within it to achieve better fault tolerance and update protection using Azure Portal.
      
      Prerequisites: An active Azure subscription
      Permission to create resources: Owner or Contributor role

Step 1: Sign in to Azure Portal

      Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in with your credentials.

Step 2: Create an Availability Set

      In the left-hand menu, click "Create a resource". In the search box, type "Availability Set" and select it. Click Create.  
      Fill in the details:  
      Subscription: Select your subscription  
      Resource Group: Create a new one or use an existing  
      Name: e.g. avset-demo
      Region: Choose a region e.g. UK South  
      Fault Domains: Choose 2 or 3 (default is 2)  
      Update Domains: 5 (default is 5)  
      Use managed disks: Yes
      Click Review + create, then click Create.

Step 3: Create a Virtual Machine in Availability Set

      In Azure Portal, go to Virtual Machines. Click + Create => Azure virtual machine.
      
      On Basics tab:  
      Fill in VM details:  
      Availability options: Select Availability Set  
      Choose the Availability Set you just created (avset-demo)  
      Complete the rest of VM setup: size, disk, networking, etc. 
      Details can be found in the other tutorial "Lab 1 Create Virtual Machine using Azure Portal". 
      
      Click Review + Create, then Create.  
      Repeat these steps to add more VMs to the same Availability Set.
      
Step 4: Verify the settings
  
      Go to Availability Sets in the portal. Click on as-demo. 
      Under Instances, you will see the list of VMs and their assigned Fault Domain and Update Domain.  
      This confirms your VMs are spread for high availability.

Use Cases

      Ideal for the following scenarios:  
      Web server clusters  
      Internal line-of-business apps  
      Any stateful workload needing uptime within a region
